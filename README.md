# SupplyChainAI - AI Model for Inventory Optimization

## üìå Project Overview
SupplyChainAI is an AI-powered predictive analytics model designed to enhance inventory management and optimize supply chain efficiency. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data, supplier performance, seasonal trends, and production schedules, enabling businesses to:

- Forecast demand accurately.
- Identify supply chain risks.
- Optimize inventory levels and reduce costs.
- Process real-time data for dynamic decision-making.

## üöÄ Core Functionality
### ‚úÖ Demand Forecasting
- Predicts future inventory demand based on historical data.
- Utilizes time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, and Prophet.

### ‚úÖ Supply Chain Risk Analysis
- Detects anomalies and disruptions in the supply chain (e.g., supplier delays, stock shortages).
- Uses AI-based anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.

### ‚úÖ Cost Optimization
- Determines optimal stock levels to reduce excess inventory and minimize holding costs.
- Employs linear programming for cost-effective inventory management.

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Data Processing
- Continuously updates forecasts using new sales and supplier data.
- Can integrate with external databases and APIs for real-time updates.

## üõ† Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Load Dataset
- The dataset `inventory-dataset.csv` is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for preprocessing.
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Inventory Management Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hetulparmar/inventory-management-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Converts `OrderDate` to datetime format.
- Extracts time-based features (Year, Month, Weekday).
- Clips `ProductListPrice` to a reasonable range.
- Selects relevant features for model training.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations
- Visualizes category distribution, order status distribution, and credit limit distribution.
- Analyzes the correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

- ![Product Price vs Order Quantity](img/5.jpg)
- ![Monthly Order Trends](img/6.jpg)
- ![Feature Correlation Matrix](img/7.jpg)

### Step 4: Data Encoding & Normalization
- Encodes categorical variables using Label Encoding.
- Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.

### Step 5: Train-Test Split
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

### Step 6: Model Training & Prediction
- **ARIMA**: Trained using SARIMAX for time series forecasting.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting model trained on structured features.
- **LSTM**: A deep learning model trained on sequential sales data.

### Step 7: Model Evaluation
- Evaluates models using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R-Squared Score (R¬≤)**
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

### Step 8: Selecting & Saving the Best Model
- Compares model performances and selects the best one based on RMSE.
- Saves the best model in the following formats:
  - `XGBoost`: `best_model_xgb.pkl`
  - `LSTM`: `best_model_lstm.h5`
  - `ARIMA`: `best_model_arima.pkl`
